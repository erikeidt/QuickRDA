===QuickRDA version 4.4.4=== 12/10/2012 dpenkler@gmail.com
Bug Fix: dropdowns not generating for items in metamodel -> now reading metamodels with viz=true for DD

===QuickRDA version 4.4.3=== 11/14/2012 dpenkler@gmail.com
Independent metamodel loads:
Worksheets were the name ends with the string "Metamodel" will be loaded as metamodel.
All metamodels are loaded before default pattern file (QuickRDA.txt) and any standard worksheet models.

Metamodel files are now split into two files:
a) QuickRDA.xlam now contains only the DMI
b) MetaModel.xlam contains the BCS,CSA etc metamodels
These are provided in the same directory as the QuickRDA.jar file.

The metamodel must 
  - either be included as a tab in the active workbook were the name 
    of the worksheet of the tab must end with the string "Metamodel".
  - or it must be included by specifying the name of the metamodel workbook (MetaModel) in column A

Dropdown build processing ignores all filters in the worksheet column.

Fixed Tooltip for nodes in the diagrams

Only those queries (filters) are added that are refered to in the build column.
This allows a single pattern file to contain many filters but to add only those that are relevant for the current build avoiding reference to non-existant entities refered to in the filters. 
The default pattern file is also treated the same way, i.e. any filters that are not used in the build will not be added.

===QuickRDA version 4.4.2=== 10/16/2012 dpenkler@gmail.com
---Minor Enhancements---
	 Dropdown generation now automatically adds the following filter to the dropdown build: /filter=TemplateFilter;hide

===QuickRDA version 4.4.1=== 10/1/2012
---Minor Enhancements---

===QuickRDA version 4.4=== 8/27/2012
	First Open Source Version

===QuickRDA version 4.3.7=== 8/27/2012
---Bug Fixes---
	A number of bug fixes with pattern matching:
		some matches were erroneously rejected as being cyclical
			fixing that required duplicate match detection to prevent stack overflow
		detection wasn't accounting for null (as wild card) in parent left or right
		detection wasn't continuing to look for longer matches after valid match
---Minor Enhancements---
	Now finding patterns of arbitrary depth

===QuickRDA version 4.3.6=== 8/20/2012
---Minor Enhancements---
	/showtype allows qualifier as in: /showtype=Role
		which means that only instances of Role (and Role's subclases) will show [type], but others will not
	/vstack= provides vertical stacking as in: /vstack=Role
		specifies only instances of Role (and Role's subclasses) are shown stacked
	(NOTE: the original /showtype (without =) engages both type showing and vertical attach stacking)
	Clearing of all validations on dropdown operation is skipped for the worksheet having the build table.

===QuickRDA version 4.3.5=== 8/17/2012
---Bug Fixes---
	fixed bug with bad gv node of "null" coming out in .svg for Value types that are off view (not revealed to the graph)
		(the correct behavior is a mini node instead)

===QuickRDA version 4.3.4=== 7/30/2012
---Bug Fixes---
	Move /patfile= processing from phase 0 to phase 2 so it can see metamodel extensions (and model elements)

===QuickRDA version 4.3.3=== 7/25/2012
---Minor Enhancements---
	New options (passed thru to GraphViz):
	/nodesize= where the default value is 10 
		"attached" items shrink by 1 font size per attachment nesting, so when changing the node font size, you have to tell QuickRDA...
---Bug Fixes---
	NPE in linkSecondaries

===QuickRDA version 4.3.2=== 7/25/2012
---Minor Enhancements---
	Subclasses of Value now get separate copy for each arrow source and/or target.
	New options (passed thru to GraphViz):
	/separation= where the default value is: ranksep="0.8" nodesep="0.8"
	/nodefont= where the default value is: fontname=Sans fontsize=12
	/edgefont= where the default value is fontname=Sans fontsize=10 labeldistance=5 
		Note that /small is equivalent to:
					/separation=ranksep="0.3" nodesep="0.3"
					/nodefont=fontname=Sans fontsize=8
					/edgefont=fontname=Sans fontsize=5 labeldistance=3
		and /small /small is equivalent to:
					/separation=ranksep="0.2" nodesep="0.2"
					/nodefont=fontname=Sans fontsize=6
					/edgefont=fontname=Sans fontsize=4 labeldistance=3
---Bug Fixes---
	Fixed null value recognition due to changes in JACOB 1.17 (still works with JACOB 1.15, too)

===QuickRDA version 4.2.5=== 05/31/2012
---Minor Enhancements---
	negation operation supported in queries,
		via "unless" keyword for queries

===QuickRDA version 4.2.4=== 05/23/2012
---Minor Enhancements---
	/hideinf hides the results of all inferences (revealed by default) this option makes filtering work better
	build inclusion can now specify exclusion of a particular column by column header name, which has the same effect as hiding the column
		but can be codified in the build table
		instead of "i" or "x" you can add a list of columns to exclude, e.g.: "x-Value Field" assuming Value Field is a column header name.
	/gvopt= allows specification of graphviz options, such as "overlap=prism overlap_scaling=6 repulsiveforce="2.0" layout=sfdp"
	added /showtype option for information modeling
	support for modeling of values as attachments
	build table v2 replaces top row of build table with bottom row of build table, use (!) Workbook instead of Workbook
