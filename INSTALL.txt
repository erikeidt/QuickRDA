Here’s the set up for binaries:

Determine a folder suitable for executables (we'll refer to it as the QuickRDA home folder).

Unpack the files of QuickRDA-Bits.zip into this QuickRDA home folder.

Obtain the JACOB libraries from here:
	zip download --> http://sourceforge.net/projects/jacob-project/
and unpack them into a folder called "JACOB" inside this QuickRDA home folder.

Double-click on the .xlam file to install it into Excel, then use the pushpin button. 

Download and install GraphViz 2.28.
	http://www.graphviz.org/

We recommend Firefox with the QuickViz Firefox plugin for viewing .svg files.
	http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/
	https://github.com/erikeidt/QuickViz/downloads

(You don't necessarily need to have Firefox as your default browser,
if you like, you can merely set the .svg file associations in windows toward firefox.)

QuickRDA also uses Java.

Here’s the set up to work in eclipse:
 
Prerequisites:    
	git command line tools if desired (or just download zip files)
	eclipse (juno)
 
(You don’t need GraphViz, Firefox, or QuickViz for the build to work.)
 
You want to set up the following folders somewhere as siblings of each other:
 
  (1)	JACOB — this folder is just unpacked copy of jacob-1.17-M2.zip from SourceForge into a subfolder called JACOB.
  		Please NOTE: The build expects an extra hierarchical level here so, use an sub folder also named JACOB:
  			JACOB/JACOB/ should have the JACOB files (jacob.jar, jacob*.dll, LICENSE, README).
	zip download --> http://sourceforge.net/projects/jacob-project/
 
  (2)	JEB — download from github using this command line:
	for git --> git clone https://github.com/erikeidt/JEB.git
	zip download --> visit https://github.com/erikeidt/JEB
 
  (3)	QuickRDA-XLFiles — download from github using:
	for git --> git clone https://github.com/erikeidt/QuickRDA-XLFiles.git
	zip download --> visit https://github.com/erikeidt/QuickRDA-XLFiles
 
  (4)	QuickRDA — download from github using:
	for git --> git clone https://github.com/erikeidt/QuickRDA.git
	zip download --> visit https://github.com/erikeidt/QuickRDA
 
Then launch eclipse and “Import…”    “Existing Projects into Workspace” (this order is preferred):
	(1) JEB, (2) QuickRDA-XLFiles, (3) QuickRDA.
 
That’s it!  It should automatically have built everything by the time you’re done.  
 
You’ll can install the development version from QuickRDA\bin (i.e. install the QuickRDA.xlam file) and, 
you can find the binary bits for distribution in QuickRDA\bin\QuickRDA-Bits.zip.

There is also (5) the GeneratorPluginExample for doing independent generator plugins.
	https://github.com/erikeidt/QuickRDA-GeneratorPluginExample.git

The QuickRDA build is set up to allow QuickRDA/bin to be the QuickRDA home folder for the binaries.
Install the .xlam file copy from the QuickRDA/bin folder.
